### How to publish a new version using github package manager

Follow the official [guideline](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages) provided by github to publish a new version of this library into the github package registry.


### Installing the library from other projects

To add this library to a project the location of the npm registry needs to be updated for the `@modusintegration` organization to point to GitHub package manager. A GitHub generated token is needed to download the package from the registry. More details about this process is also on the official [guideline](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-packages-with-github-packages/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages).

Steps:

- Add or update the .npmrc file on the root folder of the project that is going to use the library, with the following information:
```
    //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_PACKAGES_TOKEN}
    @modusintegration:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

- Actually install this library with `npm install`

```bash
npm install @modusintegration/mbox-common-db-configuration --save
```

Update the Docker related files as follows:

- Update `Dockerfile` with :

```
    ARG GITHUB_PACKAGES_TOKEN

    COPY .npmrc .npmrc

    RUN npm install
    
    RUN rm -f .npmrc
```

### Building and running: 

You need a GitHub Access Token as described in the official guide is [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).

Once you have the token you need to set the value of the `GITHUB_PACKAGES_TOKEN` environment variable. 

- For locally running using `npm start`, the `GITHUB_PACKAGES_TOKEN` should be set as environment variable on your local machine

- For building a docker image for the project installing this library, the token should be set doing: 
    ```
     docker build --build-arg GITHUB_PACKAGES_TOKEN=changeme .
     ```

- For docker-compose use, you should add the args description inside the build tag related to the app installing the library. Example:

```
    build:
        context: ..
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
        args: 
            GITHUB_PACKAGES_TOKEN: changeme
```

- Installing the library from other projects that build on CircleCi

Update the `config.yml` file inside the `.circleci` folder adding the line:

```
    extra_build_args: "--build-arg GITHUB_PACKAGES_TOKEN=$GITHUB_PACKAGES_TOKEN"
```

Add `GITHUB_PACKAGES_TOKEN` as environment variable on the project settings on CircleCi
